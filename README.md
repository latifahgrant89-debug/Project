b. Description
Our project aims to create a scholarship match quiz website specialize in the DMV area. It targets juniors and seniors in high school through personalized matches based on user response.

c. Background 
Our project is important because access to scholarships can make a huge difference for students who want to go to college but face financial barriers. By creating a simple and organized way to find opportunities, this project can help reduce stress, promote equal access to education, and motivate more students to apply for financial aid. Therefore, our goal was to create a website that was simple to use by only relying on the user’s input to generate scholarships that best fit their economic need.


d.Methodology
Languages:
• HTML – Used to structure the scholarship webpage, navigation bar, and content layout.
• CSS – Used to style the interface, apply gradients, spacing, hover effects, and create a clean, user-friendly design.
• JavaScript – Used to handle interactive elements such as dynamic scholarship displays or future form functionality.

Frameworks/Libraries/Tools:
• GitHub & GitHub Codespaces – Used for storing project files, managing updates, and collaboration with group members.
• VS Code – Primary code editor used to write and test HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
• Live Server Extension – Used for real time webpage preview and debugging during development.
Data Structures:
• Lists/Arrays – Used to organize scholarship entries, links, and navigation items for structured display.
• Objects – Helpful for grouping scholarship details such as GPA, focus area, and link information.

f. Future Work
Completion Estimate 95% of the initial progress completed 


Future Improvements: Add more scholarship information, Add user login information, time management, 


Limitations: lack the user interactive such as better advancement of technology, less of visuals,

2. Individual Contributions
Member 1: Naviah Owens
a. Contributions
Technical:


Create the quiz questions logic in JavaScript, including collecting form inputs, scoring scholarships, and generating personalized results 
Designed and structured the full questions.html page that includes the form layout, dropdowns, checkboxes, and result sections
Built a custom questions.css stylesheet to handle layout, gradients, responsiveness, button styling, nav bar effects, and overall visual design


Non-Technical:


Tested the quiz multiple times and helped identify bugs or styling issues 
Researched different CSS ideas such as gradients, hover effects, mobile friendly layout
Communicate to my team members to coordinate how pages and styling would fit the overall project theme


b. Learning Outcomes & Challenges
I learned how to build an interactive quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on how to collect user input using form elements such as checkboxes,dropdown, and radio buttons. I've learned how to generate dynamic results and insert them into a page using JavaScript. One challenge I faced was organizing the JavaScript logic so that the scholarship scoring system could make sense and did not break if certain answers were left blank.I struggle with keeping the HTML, CSS, and JS connected and making sure everything is updated correctly after submission.

a. Contributions
Technical:


Coded and designed HTML and CSS structure for:
Navigation bar 
Homepage
Background Image
Assisted with logo function
Helped design questions page 
Found 5 contributing scholarships 


Non-Technical:
Troubleshoot code and debugged code.
Communicated and worked with a team member outside of group meetings.


b. Learning Outcomes & Challenges
Reflect on what you learned and the obstacles you faced.


For this project, I designed and coded the home page in HTML and CSS. I coded a navigation bar with hover that makes the color change and slightly enlarges each word to make it fun and interactive; I also worked on sizing and fonts in the nav bar and ensured a uniformed scheme throughout the website.  I tried to pick a color scheme that felt really lively and matched the vibe of the site. I did run into some trouble getting the background image to blend well and figuring out the right sizing, but I worked through it. I also helped design and format the question page and helped debug some issues where parts of the code overlapped or different languages didn’t work together at first.Finally, I helped with the logo function, allowing the web application to redirect you to the homepage when you click on it. Overall, this project helped me get better at coding, design, and solving problems as I went.

b. Learning Outcomes & Challenges
Reflect on what you learned and the obstacles you faced.
 I learned how to connect Python with HTML in order to integrate a smooth transition when clicking the “apply now” for scholarships. Additionally, working in a group taught me how to communicate and divide tasks effectively. A challenge I faced was debugging input errors, but I learned to test functions while cooperating with my group members
